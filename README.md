# General-Python

The purpose of this repository is to hold some general Python scripts for teaching/tutoring and for examples that could be used if I teach later on.  
I plan to add the following tutorial scripts:

1. Data types, logical & math operators, and simple data structures
2. Conditional statements, loops, error handling, and functions
3. Object oriented programming
4. Advanced data structures

Some other scripts will be added as well as examples that may be used as base code for bigger projects.

- Yahoo stock pull
  *A basic web scraper that pulls stock data from yahoo.com during the trading day
   The while loop needs to be updated to run during 9:30 - 4 pm stock market time.  Will get to it eventually.
   
 - NBA game simulation
   This program simulates an NBA game based off team statistics in the 2020 season.  Only two teams have been built in so far, and I still need to implement three pointers, free      throws, and turnovers.
