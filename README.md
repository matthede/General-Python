# General-Python

The purpose of this repository is to hold some general Python scripts for teaching/tutoring and for examples that could be used if I teach later on.  
I plan to add the following tutorial scripts:

1. Data types, logical & math operators, and simple data structures
2. Conditional statements, loops, error handling, and functions
3. Object oriented programming
4. Advanced data structures

Some other scripts will be added as well as examples that may be used as base code for bigger projects.

- Yahoo stock pull
  *A basic web scraper that pulls stock data from yahoo.com during the trading day
